# About me

Hello, I usually go by the name Bitwise on the internets, but you might now me with my real life name ??? ?????.  
This is my little corner on the internet where I share my opinions about stuff and things, mostly related to tech and software engineering.

### The obsession begins

I was interested in tech and the software world from an early age. Pretty much as soon as I got my first desktop computer at the age of 6.  
I remember tinkering with my old underpowered machine to squeeze out every little ounce of performance I can so I can play the "newest" 5 year old AAA titles.

That or hacking away at my CS 1.6 server where only a fraction of the 10 or so "regulars" had any idea the owner of the server was half their age and that most server "downtimes" were primarily caused by my mother turning off my computer.

### In the oven

I started "writing" code when I was 12 years old. Like many others, the idea of GameDev brought me into the programming world.
My first language was C#. How else would I write my Unity scripts?

As the years progressed I jumped between many different fields beside just GameDev. WebDev, competitive programming (DSA), computer graphics and visualisations (mostly via [Procoessing](https://processing.org/)) and IoT.

Besides dozens of unfinished side projects about what caught my interested at a given week, I eventually found the world of Linux and even daily drove Arch (BTW!) for a couple of years. Riced up i3 with Polybar and all!

I did eventually manage to finish some projects! A couple of games in Unity along with an IoT (ish) client/server redesign of my school's "student radio" system (which you can find on my GitHub).  
These aren't the only useful/finished projects but certainly the ones I'm most proud of.

### The inevitable

It's a theory of mine that no dev can escape the WebDev trinity. One way or another you end up having to write at least some HTML/JS/CSS.  
While my first encounter was not particularly eventful (back in the jQuery and Bootstrap days). The "modern" era of frameworks, like React, certainly ignited a passion in me.

I absolutely hated React, Babel and WebPack. I did not understand why all of the sudden thing got so complex. So I got curious and dug deeper.  
Call it Stockholm syndrome or whatever, but I fell in love with the ugly beast that is WebDev and eventually landed a job in the industry.

### Nowadays

I get my WebDev fix at my day job so I've started branching out into fields I find interesting in my spare time.

Golang, Rust and generally lower level code has caught my passion now. Working on a visualisations and simulations of emergent behaviour (mostly using [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)). Still holding out hope to build a controller for a pair/group of drones that can interact autonomously and complete some basic task.

### IRL

I fell in love with Aikido recently and have been training quite regularly. There's something about it I can't quite place, but in either case, what I am certain about is that it is having a positive effect on me and I feel compelled to keep going.

I'm also an avid traveller. Exploring new cities or long hikes in nature never fail to excite me. Maybe in in your country right now?
