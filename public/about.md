# About me

Hello, I usually go by the name Bitwise on the internets, but you might now me with my real life name ??? ?????.  
This is my little corner on the internet where I share my opinions about stuff and things, mostly related to tech and software engineering.

### The obsession begins

I was interested in tech and the software world from an early age. Pretty much as soon as I got my first desktop computer at the age of 6.  
I remember tinkering with my old underpowered machine to squeeze out every little ounce of performance I can so I can play the "newest" 5 year old AAA titles.

That or hacking away at my CS 1.6 server where only a fraction of the 10 or so "regulars" had any idea the that most server "downtimes" were primarily caused by my mother turning off my computer while I was outside.

### In the oven

I started "writing" code when I was 12 years old. Like many others, the idea of GameDev brought me into the programming world.
My first language was C#. How else would I write my Unity scripts?

As the years progressed I jumped between many different fields beside just GameDev. Web-Dev, competitive programming (DSA), computer graphics and visualisations (mostly via [Procoessing](https://processing.org/)) and IoT.

Besides dozens of unfinished side projects about what caught my interested at a given week, I eventually found the world of Linux and even daily drove Arch (BTW!) for a couple of years. Riced up i3 with Polybar and all! Now I'm happily settled with Fedora and KDE.

I did eventually manage to finish some projects! A couple of games in Unity along with an IoT (ish) client/server redesign of my school's "student radio" system (which you can still find on my GitHub).  
These aren't the only useful/finished projects but certainly the more notable ones.

### The inevitable

It's a theory of mine that no dev can escape the Web-Dev trinity. One way or another you eventually end up writing at least some HTML/JS/CSS.  
While my first encounter was not particularly eventful (back in the jQuery and Bootstrap days). The "modern" era of frameworks, like React, certainly ignited a passion in me.

I was baffled by React, Babel, WebPack, Enzyme and JS on the BE. I did not understand why all of the sudden thing got so complex. So I got curious and dug deeper.  
Call it Stockholm syndrome, but I fell in love with the ugly beast that is Web-Dev and eventually landed a job in the industry.

### Nowadays

I get my Web-Dev fix at my day job so I've started branching out into fields I find interesting in my spare time.

Golang, Rust and generally lower level code has caught my attention now. Working on a visualisations and simulations of emergent behaviour (mostly using [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)). Still holding out hope to build a controller for a pair/group of drones that can interact autonomously and complete some basic task.

### IRL

I fell in love with Aikido recently and have been training quite regularly. There's something about it I can't quite place, but in either case, what I am certain about is that it is having a positive effect on me and I feel compelled to keep going.

I'm also an avid traveller. Exploring new cities or long hikes in nature never fail to excite me. Maybe in in your country right now?
